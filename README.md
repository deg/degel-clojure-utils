# degel-clojure-utils

A grab-bag of utility functions I'm using in other Clojure and
ClojureScript projects. As this continues to grow, I intend to slowly
organize and document this mess.  For now, dig in.

## Usage

For the latest version, include `[degel-clojure-utils "0.1.12"]` in your
`project.clj`.


When including this library in a ClojureScript project, note that you
also need to add the following to the ClojureScript compiler options
of each `:build` in your
[lein-cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild)
configuration:

```clojure
:libs [""]
```

(For more info, see [pprng's
README](https://github.com/cemerick/pprng) and [this ClojureScript
issue discussion](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-526).
